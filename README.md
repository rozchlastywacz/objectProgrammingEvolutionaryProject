# objectProgrammingEvolutionaryProject

This project is based upon requirements provided by tutor and lecturer of object-oriented programming course **Aleksander Smywi≈Ñski-Pohl** ([GitLab](https://github.com/apohllo), [Homepage](http://apohllo.pl/))
and that course is a part of my field of study - computer science - at Faculty of Computer Science, Electronics and Telecommunications at AGH UST.
